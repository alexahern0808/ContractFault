# The contractfault contract & manifest format

This document specifies the two input formats that `contractfault` ingests —
the **contract** and the **consumer manifest** — and the full **change
classification table** the analyzer applies. Everything here is enforced by the
Go loaders (`internal/contract`, `internal/consumer`) and the analysis engine
(`internal/analyze`); the format is intentionally small enough to author by
hand yet expressive enough to detect consumer-affecting change.

## 1. Contract document

A contract is a single JSON object describing one version of an API surface.

```json
{
  "service": "orders-api",
  "version": "1.4.0",
  "types": { "...": { } },
  "endpoints": [ { } ]
}
```

| Field       | Type                | Required | Meaning                                             |
|-------------|---------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `service`   | string              | yes      | Logical API name. Must match across compared files. |
| `version`   | string              | yes      | Human-readable version, e.g. `2.0.0`.               |
| `types`     | object of `Type`    | no       | Reusable named types keyed by type name.            |
| `endpoints` | array of `Endpoint` | yes      | Operations exposed by the service.                  |

The loader uses strict decoding (`DisallowUnknownFields`): any unrecognized key
is a hard error, so typos surface immediately rather than being silently
ignored.
