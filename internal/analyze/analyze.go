// Package analyze compares two contract versions and classifies every
// difference into a change with a category (breaking, additive, behavioral),
// a severity and a stable location, then joins the changes against consumer
// manifests to compute a blast radius.
//
// Classification rules are documented inline and mirrored in docs/CONTRACT.md.
// The engine is deterministic: identical inputs always yield byte-identical
// reports because every collection is sorted before emission.
