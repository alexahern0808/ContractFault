/**
 * contractfault-viewer reads a JSON report emitted by the Go CLI and renders
 * it as a terminal seismic map or writes an SVG impact seismograph.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   contractfault-viewer <report.json> [--svg out.svg] [--no-color]
 *
 * Exit codes mirror the analyzer: 2 when the report contains breaking changes,
 * 1 when it contains behavioral-only changes, 0 when stable. This lets the
 * viewer double as a CI gate when consuming a stored report.
