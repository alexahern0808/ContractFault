**An API contract consumer-impact analyzer that treats every version bump like a seismic event.**

*Ingest two contract versions. Feel where the ground moves. See which downstream towns get shaken.*

## Why this exists — the seismology of APIs

Most "API diff" tools hand you a wall of text and let you guess what matters.
That is like handing a geologist a list of every rock that moved and asking them
to intuit whether the village downhill is in danger. **contractfault is not a
text differ.** It is a seismograph for API contracts.

The mental model is deliberately geological:

- A **contract** is a section of crust — a versioned map of endpoints and types.
- A **change** between two versions is a **tremor** along a fault line.
- Each tremor has a **category** (does the ground crack, shift, or just settle?)
  and a **severity** (how much energy was released?).
- **Consumers** are the towns built along the fault. A tremor only matters if a
  town sits on top of it.
- The aggregate energy, felt through the towns, is the **magnitude** — a single
  0–10 number with a plain-language **verdict**: `stable`, `tremor`, `shaken`,
  or `rupture`.

That framing is not decoration. It is the actual data model. contractfault
refuses to tell you "47 things changed." It tells you *"`checkout-web` (high
criticality) will rupture because `Order.couponCode` — which it reads — was
removed, and `cancelOrder` — which it calls — changed from POST to DELETE."*
That sentence is worth more than any diff.

Two languages, one contract. The Go analyzer is the instrument; the TypeScript
viewer is the paper the trace is drawn on. They meet at a single JSON schema
(`contractfault/v1`), so either half can be replaced without touching the other.

---

## Quick start — trigger your first quake

You need Go 1.24+ and Node 20+.

```bash
# 1. Build both halves
make build

# 2. Run the analyzer over the shipped example fault
./bin/contractfault \
    -old examples/contracts/orders-v1.json \
    -new examples/contracts/orders-v2.json \
    -consumers "examples/consumers/*.json"

# 3. Or run the whole pipeline — analyze, then render the seismic map + SVG
make demo
```

No flags to memorize: `-old`, `-new`, and a `-consumers` glob are the whole
interface. Everything else has a sensible default.

---

## The terminal seismograph (real output)

Running the analyzer against the bundled `orders-api` fault produces this. It is
copied verbatim from an actual run — no artistic license:

```text

CONSUMER BLAST RADIUS
  checkout-web       high    score=35.3  breaking=3 additive=1 behavioral=1
  analytics-etl      medium  score=18.5  breaking=3 additive=1 behavioral=0
  fulfillment-worker high    score=8.3  breaking=1 additive=1 behavioral=0
  receipts-mailer    low     score=4.3  breaking=1 additive=1 behavioral=0
```

(The listing above is trimmed to the highest-severity tremors; the tool prints
all fifteen. The `##...` bar is the magnitude meter on a 0–10 scale.)

Read it top-down like a seismologist reads a drum: the biggest tremors are at
the top, each annotated with **who feels it** (`hits:`) and **how to survive it**
(`fix:`). The blast-radius footer ranks the towns by how hard they were shaken.

---

## The animated seismograph viewer

Pipe the JSON report into the TypeScript viewer to draw the fault as a station
map. Each consumer becomes a seismic station along the fault line; its dot grows
with its risk score, and its color encodes the worst tremor it felt.

```bash
# Emit JSON from the analyzer, then render an SVG seismograph
./bin/contractfault -old examples/contracts/orders-v1.json \
    -new examples/contracts/orders-v2.json \
    -consumers "examples/consumers/*.json" \
    -format json -out examples/report.json

cd viewer
node dist/cli.js ../examples/report.json --svg ../docs/assets/impact-seismograph.svg
```

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/assets/impact-seismograph.svg" alt="impact seismograph" width="80%" />
</div>

The viewer also renders a colorized terminal map with per-consumer amplitude
bars, and — like the Go CLI — exits `2` on breaking, `1` on behavioral, `0` on
stable, so it can double as a CI gate when reading a stored report.

---

## What counts as a tremor

contractfault classifies every difference into one of three categories, and each
category maps to a CI outcome. This is the crux of *not* being a text diff: the
tool understands the **semantics** of a contract, not its bytes.

| Category       | Feels like      | Examples                                              | CI |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----|
| **breaking**   | the ground cracks | endpoint removed, method flip, required field added, enum value dropped, response type changed | exit 2 |
| **behavioral** | the ground shifts | idempotency flip, field became nullable, enum value *added*, field deprecated | exit 1 |
| **additive**   | the ground settles | new optional field, new endpoint, new status code, parameter relaxed to optional | exit 0 |

The subtle cases are where the design earns its keep:

- **A required field added is breaking; an optional one is additive.** Same JSON
  edit, opposite blast radius.
- **Adding an enum value is *behavioral*, not additive** — old consumers with an
  exhaustive `switch` may fall through on the new value.
- **An idempotency flip is behavioral even though the shape is byte-identical** —
  it silently invalidates retry logic. A text differ would never catch this.
- **A parameter *addition* shakes every caller of the endpoint**, but a
  parameter *value* change only shakes consumers that set that specific param.

The complete rule table (thirty-plus codes) lives in
[`docs/CONTRACT.md`](docs/CONTRACT.md#33-rule-table).

---

## How the blast radius is computed

A tremor with no town on top of it is a curiosity, not an incident.
contractfault only counts a change against a consumer when that consumer
actually depends on the affected element:

- **Field tremor** (`Order.couponCode`) → only consumers whose manifest lists
  that field in `readsFields`/`writesFields`.
- **Type tremor** (`OrderStatus`) → consumers referencing any field of that type.
- **Endpoint tremor** (`getReceipt` removed) → every consumer that calls it.
- **New required parameter** → every caller of the endpoint, because they all
  suddenly send an incomplete request.

Each surviving (tremor, town) pair releases energy equal to
`severityWeight × criticalityWeight`. A `high`-criticality consumer amplifies a
critical break to `4.0 × 3 = 12.0`; a `low`-criticality consumer feeling the
same break releases only `4.0 × 1 = 4.0`. The town's construction quality
matters as much as the quake.

The raw energy is then compressed onto a Richter-like 0–10 dial:

```
magnitude = 10 · (1 − 1 / (1 + raw / 12))
```

so a fistful of critical breaks dominates the reading while an avalanche of
harmless `info` changes never saturates the meter.

## The contract format in 30 seconds

A contract is OpenAPI-like but self-contained. Endpoints are correlated across
versions by a stable `id`, so renaming a path is reported as a *mutation*, not a
delete-plus-add.

```json
{
  "service": "orders-api",
  "version": "1.4.0",
  "types": {
    "OrderStatus": { "kind": "string", "enum": ["pending", "paid", "shipped"] },
    "Order": {
      "kind": "object",
      "fields": {
        "id":     { "type": "string", "required": true },
        "status": { "type": "OrderStatus", "required": true },
        "note":   { "type": "string", "nullable": true }
      }
    }
  },
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "id": "getOrder", "method": "GET", "path": "/orders/{id}", "idempotent": true,
      "params": [{ "name": "id", "in": "path", "type": "string", "required": true }],
      "responses": { "200": "Order", "404": "Error" }
    }
  ]
}
```

A consumer manifest declares only what it touches — coarse enough to publish
without exposing your source tree, precise enough to compute a real blast radius:

```json
{
  "name": "checkout-web",
  "team": "storefront",
  "criticality": "high",
