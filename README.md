**An API contract consumer-impact analyzer that treats every version bump like a seismic event.**

*Ingest two contract versions. Feel where the ground moves. See which downstream towns get shaken.*

## Why this exists — the seismology of APIs

Most "API diff" tools hand you a wall of text and let you guess what matters.
That is like handing a geologist a list of every rock that moved and asking them
to intuit whether the village downhill is in danger. **contractfault is not a
text differ.** It is a seismograph for API contracts.

The mental model is deliberately geological:

- A **contract** is a section of crust — a versioned map of endpoints and types.
- A **change** between two versions is a **tremor** along a fault line.
- Each tremor has a **category** (does the ground crack, shift, or just settle?)
  and a **severity** (how much energy was released?).
- **Consumers** are the towns built along the fault. A tremor only matters if a
  town sits on top of it.
- The aggregate energy, felt through the towns, is the **magnitude** — a single
  0–10 number with a plain-language **verdict**: `stable`, `tremor`, `shaken`,
  or `rupture`.

That framing is not decoration. It is the actual data model. contractfault
refuses to tell you "47 things changed." It tells you *"`checkout-web` (high
criticality) will rupture because `Order.couponCode` — which it reads — was
removed, and `cancelOrder` — which it calls — changed from POST to DELETE."*
That sentence is worth more than any diff.

Two languages, one contract. The Go analyzer is the instrument; the TypeScript
viewer is the paper the trace is drawn on. They meet at a single JSON schema
(`contractfault/v1`), so either half can be replaced without touching the other.

---

## Quick start — trigger your first quake

You need Go 1.24+ and Node 20+.

```bash
# 1. Build both halves
make build

# 2. Run the analyzer over the shipped example fault
./bin/contractfault \
    -old examples/contracts/orders-v1.json \
    -new examples/contracts/orders-v2.json \
    -consumers "examples/consumers/*.json"

# 3. Or run the whole pipeline — analyze, then render the seismic map + SVG
make demo
```

No flags to memorize: `-old`, `-new`, and a `-consumers` glob are the whole
interface. Everything else has a sensible default.

## The terminal seismograph (real output)

Running the analyzer against the bundled `orders-api` fault produces this. It is
copied verbatim from an actual run — no artistic license:

```text

CHANGES (sorted by severity)
  !! [critical] cancelOrder                  method changed POST -> DELETE
      code: endpoint.method.changed
      hits: checkout-web
      fix : Update the HTTP verb from POST to DELETE.
  !! [critical] getReceipt                   endpoint GET /orders/{id}/receipt (getReceipt) was removed
      code: endpoint.removed
      hits: analytics-etl, receipts-mailer
      fix : Stop calling this endpoint; migrate to a replacement operation before upgrading.
