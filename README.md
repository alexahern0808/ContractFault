**An API contract consumer-impact analyzer that treats every version bump like a seismic event.**

*Ingest two contract versions. Feel where the ground moves. See which downstream towns get shaken.*

## Why this exists — the seismology of APIs

Most "API diff" tools hand you a wall of text and let you guess what matters.
That is like handing a geologist a list of every rock that moved and asking them
to intuit whether the village downhill is in danger. **contractfault is not a
text differ.** It is a seismograph for API contracts.

The mental model is deliberately geological:

- A **contract** is a section of crust — a versioned map of endpoints and types.
- A **change** between two versions is a **tremor** along a fault line.
- Each tremor has a **category** (does the ground crack, shift, or just settle?)
  and a **severity** (how much energy was released?).
- **Consumers** are the towns built along the fault. A tremor only matters if a
  town sits on top of it.
- The aggregate energy, felt through the towns, is the **magnitude** — a single
  0–10 number with a plain-language **verdict**: `stable`, `tremor`, `shaken`,
  or `rupture`.

That framing is not decoration. It is the actual data model. contractfault
refuses to tell you "47 things changed." It tells you *"`checkout-web` (high
criticality) will rupture because `Order.couponCode` — which it reads — was
removed, and `cancelOrder` — which it calls — changed from POST to DELETE."*
That sentence is worth more than any diff.

Two languages, one contract. The Go analyzer is the instrument; the TypeScript
viewer is the paper the trace is drawn on. They meet at a single JSON schema
(`contractfault/v1`), so either half can be replaced without touching the other.

---

## Quick start — trigger your first quake

You need Go 1.24+ and Node 20+.

```bash
# 1. Build both halves
make build

# 2. Run the analyzer over the shipped example fault
./bin/contractfault \
    -old examples/contracts/orders-v1.json \
    -new examples/contracts/orders-v2.json \
    -consumers "examples/consumers/*.json"

# 3. Or run the whole pipeline — analyze, then render the seismic map + SVG
make demo
```

No flags to memorize: `-old`, `-new`, and a `-consumers` glob are the whole
interface. Everything else has a sensible default.

---

## The terminal seismograph (real output)

Running the analyzer against the bundled `orders-api` fault produces this. It is
copied verbatim from an actual run — no artistic license:

```text

CONSUMER BLAST RADIUS
  checkout-web       high    score=35.3  breaking=3 additive=1 behavioral=1
  analytics-etl      medium  score=18.5  breaking=3 additive=1 behavioral=0
  fulfillment-worker high    score=8.3  breaking=1 additive=1 behavioral=0
  receipts-mailer    low     score=4.3  breaking=1 additive=1 behavioral=0
```

(The listing above is trimmed to the highest-severity tremors; the tool prints
all fifteen. The `##...` bar is the magnitude meter on a 0–10 scale.)

Read it top-down like a seismologist reads a drum: the biggest tremors are at
the top, each annotated with **who feels it** (`hits:`) and **how to survive it**
(`fix:`). The blast-radius footer ranks the towns by how hard they were shaken.

## The animated seismograph viewer

Pipe the JSON report into the TypeScript viewer to draw the fault as a station
map. Each consumer becomes a seismic station along the fault line; its dot grows
with its risk score, and its color encodes the worst tremor it felt.

```bash
# Emit JSON from the analyzer, then render an SVG seismograph
./bin/contractfault -old examples/contracts/orders-v1.json \
    -new examples/contracts/orders-v2.json \
    -consumers "examples/consumers/*.json" \
